I pray for love
Every night I get down on my knees
Beneath my cross I close my eyes
I pray for love

Yes I pray for love
It's my crave I find someone
Someone who knows
Someone like me
I pray for love

I want to feel the heavens reach
To the martyr in my blood
I don't want life to pass me by
Oh no no no no no

I pray for love
I pray for love
I pray for love

I believe my time will come
I believe somewhere in this world
There must be someone for me
I pray for love
I pray for love

A million hearts
Are close to mine
Trapped in stone
They don't want to be alone

A million hearts
They pray for love
They pray for love

I want to feel the heavens reach
To the martyr in my blood
I don't want life to pass me by
Oh no no no no no
