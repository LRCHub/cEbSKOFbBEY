Early on in my life I was confused
Took the path of someone else
Today I might be you

I can't get out
Second to none
I can't get out
Invisible sun
I'm sick, you're not
I might be you
Invisible sun

Early on in my life I made a choice
Someday I'd use a gun to stop the noise
(Stop the noise!)

Pray for love
We dance
To an inaudible drum
Stay for love
In the light
Of an invisible sun
(X2)

(Stop the noise! x4)

Early on in my life I made a choice
I couldn't go on with all the noise
All the noise
(I might be you!)

Pray for love
We dance
To an inaudible drum
Stay for love
In the light
(Stop the noise!)
Of an invisible sun
(Stop the noise!)

Hey
Invite
Follow
Pray
Follow
Invisible sun

Pray for love
We dance
To an inaudible drum
Stay for love
In the light
Of an invisible sun
(X2)
