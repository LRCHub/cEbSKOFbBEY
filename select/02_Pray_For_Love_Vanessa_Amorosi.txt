Pray for love
Won't you pray for love
Won't you pray for love, yeah
Won't you pray for love
(Pray for love)
I want to pray for love

Pray for love
(Pray for love)
Pray for love
Pray for love
Won't you pray for love

I lift my eyes up to heaven above
And what I'm asking for is all I've been dreaming of
True love is so hard to find
Won't you pray, won't you pray, won't you pray

Diamonds and pearls and fortune and fame
Some ask for sunshine and others for rain
Is what I'm asking for asking too much?
Won't you pray, won't you pray, won't you pray

Oh yeah
C'mon and pray for love
Pray for love, love, love, love

Late at night when I'm alone in my room
Whispering your name by the light of the midnight moon
I believe that day will come
Won't you pray, won't you pray, won't you pray

There's just too many lonely people
Too many lonely people in this world
Too many lonely, lonely people
Won't you pray, won't you pray

Oh, yeah
C'mon and pray for love
Pray for love, love, love, love
C'mon and pray for love

Yeah, yeah
C'mon and pray for love
C'mon and pray for love
Pray, pray, pray for love, love, love

There's just too many lonely people
Too many lonely people in this world
Too many lonely, lonely people
Too many lonely people in this world

Too many lonely boys
Too many lonely girls
Too many lonely people in this world

C'mon and pray for love
Oh, yeah
C'mon and pray for love
Pray for love
C'mon and pray for love
Pray for love
