Distance
We prayed for love
Someone in the distance
Who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts
someone in the distance
who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts
we prayed for love
It's safe to say we made it
Along the path we tread so well
And the shades we use to paint it
Can't start to show our lives parallel
It's safe to say we made it
Along the path we tread so well
And the shades we use to paint it
Can't start to show our lives parallel
distance
are we pray for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to out breaking hearts
we prayed for love
distance
It's safe to say we made it
Along the path we tread so well
And the shades we use to paint it
Can't start to show our lives parallel
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
